# Codes for videos

This project contains the code used to generate the explanatory math videos found on [hyperoot](https://www.youtube.com/@hyperoot).

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

Note, while the library Manim itself is open source and under the MIT license, the contents of this project are intended only to be used for hyperoot videos themselves.
